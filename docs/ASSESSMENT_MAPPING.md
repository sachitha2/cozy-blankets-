# Assessment mapping (reference)

This file maps the original assessment requirements to the current documentation and implementation. It is kept for reference only; the product documentation is in the other files in this directory.

| Requirement | Document / implementation |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Architecture comparison (Monolithic vs SOA) | [ARCHITECTURE_COMPARISON.md](./ARCHITECTURE_COMPARISON.md) |
| Design and development (services, clients, diagrams) | [DESIGN_DIAGRAMS.md](./DESIGN_DIAGRAMS.md), [WORKFLOWS.md](./WORKFLOWS.md), [BUSINESS_LOGIC.md](./BUSINESS_LOGIC.md), and the codebase |
| Testing and debugging | [TESTING_DOCUMENTATION.md](./TESTING_DOCUMENTATION.md) |
| Deployment techniques | [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) |

All requirements are addressed in the linked documents and the solution (ManufacturerService, DistributorService, SellerService, ClientApp, ClientAppWeb, tests, Docker, and deployment guides).
